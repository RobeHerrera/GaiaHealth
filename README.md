# How to se with Flask (integrating Python code) - tested only in windows
1- Install python (I have used 3.10):

2- Create a virtual enviroment using env as a virtualization tool, and name it as "ai_env":
`python -m venv ai_env`

3- Activate it:

cmd `C:\Users\<USER>\ai_env\Scripts\activate.bat`
or 
PS `C:\Users\<USER>\ai_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

4- Navigate to your project folder with you environment activated and install the requirements.txt:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
or simply:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

5- Run Flask app (Should run a server on "127.0.0.1", port=8080):
`python main.py`

6- Open a web browser go to "http://127.0.0.1:8080", and you should see the main website.


NOTES: File "app.yaml" is for later use.


# How to use as a Simple Server:
1- Please download the extension of LiveServer for Visual Studio Code.
2- Open templates/index.html
3- On the right bottom corner activate the Local Server.
4- Every time that you save the project the web page will get update.
